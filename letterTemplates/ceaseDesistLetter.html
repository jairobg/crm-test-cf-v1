Dear <@@DEBTHOLDERNAME@@>:
</p>

<p>
This letter is forwarded to your agency reference file number: <@@DEBTHOLDERACCOUNTNUMBER@@> and the dunning collection notices/telephone calls recently received.  Insofar as your agency is a debt collector pursuant to section 803 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you will be treated like one.  Therefore, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act – and all of its relevant provisions – will be invoked. 
</p>

<p>
YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED that this is a disputed debt pursuant to section 809 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  The specific content of said dispute was recently stated – verbally – to a collector at your agency who refused to provide their name upon request thereof.  Pursuant to the FDCPA, you are prohibited from dunning a debtor when a specific debt is disputed.
</p>

<p>
YOU ARE FURTHER NOTIFED that this is a disputed debt pursuant to section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  It is my belief that your agency has illegally reported this disputed debt to Equifax, Experian, and/or Trans Union.  If this is the case, I will most certainly litigate an action against your agency insofar as it has willfully reported a disputed debt.  Pursuant to the FCRA, your agency must notify the consumer reporting agencies of any disputed delinquency immediately upon notification thereof.  A further cause of action may exist for failure to perform this ministerial task.
</p>

<p>
YOU ARE FURTHER NOTIFED that you are prohibited from contacting my cellular telephone using an auto-dialer pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 227.  My cellular telephone number is <@@CLIENTCELLPHONE@@>.  Any expressed or implied permission to dial my cellular telephone using an auto dialer is hereby revoked.  Do not, under any circumstance, call my cellular telephone number.
</p>

<p>	
YOU ARE FURTHER NOTIFIED that I desire no further communication with your agency pursuant to section 805 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  Your agency is to CEASE and DESIST all further communication immediately.  Should I receive another piece of dunning correspondence that does not comport with the provisions of the FDCPA, I will immediate initiate litigation against your agency.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, if you do not own this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor so they are also aware of my dispute with this debt.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>
