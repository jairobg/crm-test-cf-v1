Re: <@@CLIENTNAME@@><br />
Account #: <@@DEBTHOLDERACCOUNTNUMBER@@>
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that the alleged debtor in this matter has retained this office to represent them in regards to the alleged debt associated with the above account number.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that this debt is disputed pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Please be advised that this account, as stated, is not agreed to by the alleged debtor.  Be on notice that the any subsequent demand for payment or presentation of a statement of account is specifically disputed and not agreed to by the debtor.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that, pursuant to the Telephonic Consumer Protection Act, any express or implied consent for you to contact the alleged debtor in this matter on their cellular telephone number using an auto-dialer is expressly revoked.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that on or about <@@FLDATE@@> you received a letter from this office requesting specific information documenting the alleged debt you are attempting to collect from our client.  
</p>

<p>
We are in receipt of your response in which you included a basic validation of this alleged debt.  This validation is insufficient and un-responsive to our initial request for documentation of this alleged debt.  Please forward the following documentation to this office in order to establish the validity of this debt.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The signed contract that establishes this alleged debt.
</li>
<li>
If no signed contract exists, please include a written explanation of the legal basis upon which you believe a legal debt was created. 
</li>
<li>
Copies of all bills which document the creation of this debt and the accumulation of the interest and fees you are attempting to collect in addition to the principle of this debt.
</li>
<li>
All documentation in your possession that establishes that my client is the person who incurred this debt.  (Examples:  Copy of Drivers License or some other identifying information)
</li>
<li>If you are not the original creditor, please forward a copy of the assignment and purchase contract proving your legal right to collect this debt.  If you did not obtain this debt from the Original Creditor, please provide copies of all assignments from all parties in the chain of title of this debt proving clear title from the Original Creditor through yourself.
</li>
<li>If you claim you are collecting on behalf of the Original Creditor please provide a copy of a contract which grants you the legal authority to collect this debt on beheld of the Original Creditor.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The above listed documentation is the bare minimum documentation required to create a legally enforceable debt.  Your inability to produce any of this documentation conclusively establishes that you lack the ability to legally establish this debt and you have insufficient documentation to legally report any information associated with this debt to a credit reporting agency.  
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that in the even this documentation is not produced within 30 days from the date of this letter, we expect a written acknowledgment that you lack the ability to legally establish this debt.
</p>

<p>
In the event we do not receive this documentation or the above described written acknowledgement within 30 days from the date of this letter, this office shall commence litigation on behalf of our client for your clear attempt to collect a non-valid debt against our client and your illegal reporting of information that you cannot prove.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE BE ADVISED that the alleged debtor in this matter provides you with the following statement of the account in this matter:
</p>

<p>
Account Number: <@@DEBTHOLDERACCOUNTNUMBER@@> has a zero balance and is fully satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Failure to dispute this statement of account within a reasonable time frame shall constitute consent to the correctness of the account as stated and an admission that my client is not liable for the alleged debt.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you do not own this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor so that they are also aware of my dispute with this debt.
</p>

<p>
Govern Yourself Accordingly,
</p>


<p>
Authorized Attorney
