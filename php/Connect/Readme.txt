PHP Connect solution contains just one project.  The project consists of
one PHP file and one sample data file.  The data file can be used to test
out the post processing. 
 
Just like with a lot of PHP solutions deployment of the PHP sample is as
simple as just copying the files into a directory on your server. 
 
The url that you post the index.php can be used for both sending
https://<your_secure_server>/<somefolder>/index.php
